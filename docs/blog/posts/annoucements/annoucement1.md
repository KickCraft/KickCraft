# KickCraft - A New Era Dawns!

<strong>:wave: Hey KickCrafters!</strong> We're thrilled to announce some exciting upcoming changes for KickCraft, designed to create a more streamlined, player-focused experience. As well as a new season of Kickcraft in the works. :eyes: So let's not waste any time and get right into the post! :smile:
<!-- more -->

## :material-arm-flex: Building a Stronger Team

First things first - we're redefining and restructuring staff roles to eliminate overlap and ensure clear responsibilities. This will pave the way for a more efficient team. Here's the exciting part: once the roles are set, we'll be actively seeking new members to join the KickCraft family! We'll also be reviewing existing playtester applications and welcoming new ones.

## :material-steering: Steering the Course Together

To ensure a more inclusive and well-rounded vision for the server, we'll be establishing a steering committee. This team approach will prevent personal bias and encourage collaboration on future plans. <i>These positions will be elected and not hand picked.</i> More information will be released on this in the future at some point.

## :simple-modrinth: Modrinth Integration for Seamless Play

The new server will boast official integration with Modrinth for the next modpack release. This allows for effortless player setup and simplifies any future modpack updates. While the modpack is highly recommended for full access to server features, it won't be mandatory to join the fun! Here are some of the new features you can expect to see in the new modpack:

- Greatly enhanced player customization for skins, capes, and hats!
- Revamped voice chat.
- Many new custom additions to the menus.
- Improved textures for a better building experience.
- And many more QOL features!

## :bulb: Prioritizing Player Feedback

One of the biggest learnings from the current server is the need for stronger player input. We're committed to making this a priority! Moving forward, your suggestions for features and improvements will be heavily considered to ensure the server's long-term success.

## :book: A New Home for Information - The KickCraft Wiki!

Get ready to explore our brand new wiki! This will be the central hub for all things KickCraft, from MC information to Discord details and guides. We'll even have a guide on how to contribute once things are fully settled!

## :simple-github: Transparency Through Github

For ultimate transparency, we'll be utilizing a public Github repository. This means you'll have access to our roadmap, current/past [issues](https://github.com/KickCraft/KickCraft/issues "Github Issues"), the wiki, and more, all in one place. This allows for clear communication about what the team is working on and centralizes server issue tracking. Creating an issue report [doesn't require a Github account]("Staff can create one on your behalf if you do not have a Github account"), but it's highly recommended for those who want to contribute further.

## :wheel: Keeping the Wheels Turning

While the new server is under construction, we have two options to keep the fun going! We're open to either hosting an adventure map or a modpack for your enjoyment. Additionally, the current server will remain operational on less powerful hardware, allowing you to finish up builds before a world download becomes available. If you have ideas for a map or modpack, head over to the KickCraft Forum channel on Discord to share them with the team and fellow players!

## :crying_face: Why is the current season ending?

Overall there are many reasons why we decided to end our work on the current season of KickCraft. Firstly, many people on the staff team are still very burnt out from the initial first four weeks after the server launched. In addition to that, many have already resigned from their positions due to high stress or personal issues. It doesn't make sense for the few us that are currently on the team to continue pushing ourselves to try and keep up with the current demand of the server. Additionally there are far too many issues at this point for us to remedy properly and at the same time try and push out new updates. So besides adding player shops, we will not be adding any more additional major updates in the coming weeks leading up to the next season.

This was a very hard decision to come to but was ultimately decided upon due to the current circumstances that the team is under. But with all that being said, we do not plan on giving up by any means. We all still have ambitious goals for the future but they will require much more trust and effort between staff and players alike.

## :question: What's the New Server Going to be Like?

While we don't want to spoil everything right now, we will go over a few major changes below for the upcoming season of KickCraft:

1. Much more focus on story building and lore in the world.
2. Less focus on typical Vanilla MC gameplay and a general shift towards something more akin to a MMORPG along with some minigames and events to accompany it.
3. Player feedback will be much more visible to the staff team and other players going forward instead of ideas getting lost in the void.
4. Updates will be much more consistent but less frequent than the current season where we were sporadically pushing out updates. <i>This will be visible on the public roadmap once the server launches.</i>
5. A complete revamp of in-game permissions and ranks along with hiding unusable commands.
6. And much more that we can't reveal for now! :wink:

## :clap: A Big Thank You!

From the entire admin team, we want to express our sincere gratitude for your unwavering support throughout the past couple of months. Your passion for the server fuels our motivation! We truly hope you've had an amazing experience so far, and we can't wait to embark on this exciting new chapter together. Stay tuned for further updates!

Happy Crafting!

:heart: The KickCraft Admin Team
