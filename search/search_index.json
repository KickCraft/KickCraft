Firstly, many people on the staff team are still very burnt out from the initial first four weeks after the server launched. In addition to that, many have already resigned from their positions due to high stress or personal issues. It doesn't make sense for the few us that are currently on the team to continue pushing ourselves to try and keep up with the current demand of the server. Additionally there are far too many issues at this point for us to remedy properly and at the same time try and push out new updates. So besides adding player shops, we will not be adding any more additional major updates in the coming weeks leading up to the next season.</p> <p>This was a very hard decision to come to but was ultimately decided upon due to the current circumstances that the team is under. But with all that being said, we do not plan on giving up by any means. We all still have ambitious goals for the future but they will require much more trust and effort between staff and players alike.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2024/04/10/kickcraft---a-new-era-dawns/#whats-the-new-server-going-to-be-like","title":"What's the New Server Going to be Like?","text":"<p>While we don't want to spoil everything right now, we will go over a few major changes below for the upcoming season of KickCraft:</p> <ol> <li>Much more focus on story building and lore in the world.</li> <li>Less focus on typical Vanilla MC gameplay and a general shift towards something more akin to a MMORPG along with some minigames and events to accompany it.</li> <li>Player feedback will be much more visible to the staff team and other players going forward instead of ideas getting lost in the void.</li> <li>Updates will be much more consistent but less frequent than the current season where we were sporadically pushing out updates. This will be visible on the public roadmap once the server launches.</li> <li>A complete revamp of in-game permissions and ranks along with hiding unusable commands.</li> <li>And much more that we can't reveal for now! </li> </ol>"},{"location":"blog/2024/04/10/kickcraft---a-new-era-dawns/#a-big-thank-you","title":"A Big Thank You!","text":"<p>From the entire admin team, we want to express our sincere gratitude for your unwavering support throughout the past couple of months.
